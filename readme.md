#### Final Recommendations based on the above inferences:
1. The Product Manufactures are recommended to increase their stores in the states of Indiana and Kentucky as they have very less sales.
2. As the sales of Bag Snacks and Cold cereals are high in all the years, it is recommended to have extra stock of these products in order to not loose the sales.
3. The manufactures of the Oral hygeine products should implement discounts/Coupons in order to increase the sales.
4. In Store Display and temporary price reduction doesnt appear to increase the sales. So, its better not to invest on these promotions.
5. All the top sales are from the states of Ohio and Texas. The stores in the other states should implement a change in order to increase sales though there are less number of stores.
6. All the Private label manufacturers together have highest sales. All the stores are recommended to have enough stocks of the products from General and Kellogg manufacturers.
